Feedback for Assigned_Reviewer_1:
1. Notations and Preliminaries
Assumption 1) defines \ell_p-norm hypothesis space by K-dimension vector \mathbf{w} which is used in definition of multi-class margin. There is a margin \rho_h(z):= h(\mathbf x,y)-\max_{y'\not =y} h(\mathbf x,y') for each label. The use of multi-class margin is precondition of our generalization analysis.
Assumption 2) defines loss space according to multi-class margin by L(h):=\mathbb{E}_\mu[1_{\rho_h(z)\leq 0}].
